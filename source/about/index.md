Hi there, I am Kelvin, a graduate of Asia Pacific University. I previously studied Bachelor of Science in Computer Science major in Cybersecurity. As fresh graduate, I am still enhancing my cybersecurity skills through different platforms such as `TryHackme`, and `HackTheBox`. Previously, I had undergo my internship at Maybank which allowed me to gain insight on how cybersecurity is implemented in the industry. I am a patient and hardworking person and will try to learn as much as I can. 

Aside from that, I am an active `CTF player` that joins both online and physical CTFs. Through my experiences in the CTF journey I was able to sharpen my penetration testing skills further other than just academically. In 2022, I was also one of the 28 participants in the First Edition Malaysia Cybersecurity Camp 2022 organized by Re:Hack to train and enhance cybersecurity skills of university students around Malaysia. I had the opportunity to meet seasoned professionals in the field and had been able to work along with multiple cybersecurity enthusiasts. I had also joined many cybersecurity conferences such as `HITB-Con`, `CyberDSA`, `CyDes`, etc...

I will grind non-stop to improve my technical skills as I aim to work in international grounds.
