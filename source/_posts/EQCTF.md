As I found that EQCTF platform has been widely used by local CTF players, and was supported by local universities for module lessons and skills enhancement purposes, I think its only fair that a blog post explaining why the infamous platform was created. <!--more-->

# EQCTF Background
The initial thought occured during my time as an FSEC Challenge creator, which is to have a personal CTF platform just to create challenges when free time exists or have some interesting idea to store some challenges, without `"hAvInG aNy TiMe cOnStRaInt"` that could bring stress over creating challenges. Of course, this was just a random thought and maybe if one day I have any energy or time to eventually setup everything to create the platform itself. 

Two chinese guy walk into a bar.....(idk I don't have any idea for that joke...so) and they drink. So, at one point, me and this random CTF grinder named [KS](https://callmeks.github.io/), always drink a certain craft beer brand (Sherlock says its Equilibrium, duh) because we found the packaging is always interesting (fr). And then the dude was like `wE sHouLd NaMe SoMeThInG wItH ThIssSsS`. Then when the beer kicks in the brain, instead of getting drunk talking bout life dude was asking like what if we created our own CTF platform and just for fun, as like a portfolio or something. I'm like, this is interesting, let's do it. Welp, what if we drag in some fun challenge creators that may also be interested in this as well? so we decided to approach some close friends of ours:
- [vicevirus](https://vicevirus.github.io/) 
- [shen](https://chuajianshen.github.io/) 
- [warlocksmurf](https://warlocksmurf.github.io/) 
- [pikaroot](https://pikaroot.github.io/)
- [JesusCries](https://jesuscries.gitbook.io/)
- [JP](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-phang-kah-chun/)

As all of them are interested in putting efforts in making this platform come true, all left is to give a name on what it should be called....So yea, Equilibrium CTF, then cut short to EQCTF (lmao yea). Our aim is simple, platform allows us to dump ideas and challenges at anytime, didn't plan on making it big, or like to say `mY pLaTfOrM iS bEtTeR`, hell no bruh. It just exist there for us to have our own fun, instead of solving challenges, we create challenges, and have somewhere to put it and share with people. All the cost and fees for deployment are split between us equally, not sponsored, just to make it accessible for everyone. As it is just a platform to test our own creativity and have fun, we specifically created a `brainfuck` category, which is for challenges that players would call it `"weird af"` or `"cursed"`.

One day, out of random thought, I asked the team if we can hold a housewarming miniCTF competition, to let people know EQCTF has been launched. It was kinda a push at the start to have it happen as we have our previous challenges that was used in old CTFs on the platform, and limited new challenges created and of course, it was again, just a random idea of making it happen. But yes, it happened, and out of expectation, we have over 150+ participants joining, and players from different countries as well. Grand launch it was indeed.

After all that, we have good feedbacks from the players and they like our challenges. So maybe this could be an annual thing? let's see, legit no promises hehe. Also, a quick note, if you have any feedback that can help EQCTF in improving your experience, do contact us at [admin@eqctf.com](admin@eqctf.com).

# EQCTF Supported by Universities
After a period of time where miniCTF has ended, we noticed that there are still players solving the challenges daily, some are super active in opening tickets and ask for hints and guidance on solving the challenges. One of the players mentioned within the ticket that he wanted to solve the challenge and do a writeup as an assignment submission for his module, in which his lecturer suggested to look into EQCTF's challenges. It was quite a surprise when I found out that the platform was not only actively used by students and but has already become a place where lecturers supports the challenges on the platform. It is amazing how much support EQCTF gotten within a few months period~ But also....it's funny to think lecturers may need to deal with "what is brainfuck category? Can I do a writeup for brainfuck?" AHAHAHA (jk)

I would say I'm super happy having this team to have EQCTF created and shared with all the CTF players. As a CTF player myself, it's always nice to see more people take interest in joining the fun and getting brain damage by solving challenges together~
